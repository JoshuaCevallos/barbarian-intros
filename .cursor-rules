# .cursor-rules

# Project-wide rules for coding, commenting, and collaboration

[general]

# Use modern, clean, readable code and structure.

# All code (HTML, CSS, JS) must be thoroughly commented.

# Comments should explain the purpose of each section and any non-obvious logic.

# Use placeholder images for profiles unless otherwise specified.

# Keep the UI and UX as close to the Hinge app as possible.

[html]

# Use semantic HTML5 elements where possible.

# Each major section (profile card, prompt, image, etc.) must have a comment explaining its purpose.

# Use external CSS and JS files; do not use inline styles or scripts.

# Use placeholder image URLs for all images unless real images are provided.

[css]

# Use a modern, minimalist, Hinge-inspired design: light gray background, white rounded cards, soft shadows, clean font.

# Comment each major block (layout, card, button, responsive, etc.) and any non-obvious style.

# Prefer system fonts or Inter for a modern look.

# Ensure the app is responsive and mobile-friendly.

[js]

# All functions and key logic must be commented.

# Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.

# Like/dislike logic should be smooth and user-friendly.

# Remove unused or legacy code.

# Keyboard navigation should be supported (arrows, enter).

[collaboration]

# Discuss major feature or design changes before implementation.

# Keep code and comments clean and up-to-date.

# Use placeholder data for development; replace with real data only when ready.

[accessibility]

# Ensure buttons and navigation are accessible via keyboard.

# Use alt text for all images.
